A free plugin that integrates some helpful import/export functionality into Theme Blvd themes.

== Description ==

**NOTE: This plugin requires Theme Blvd framework v2.5.2+**

When using a Theme Blvd theme, this plugin adds some helpful import and export functionality.

1. **Live Demo Import:** The default WordPress importer is extended to fully setup a copy of your theme's live demos.  After importing all of the standard data like posts, pages, attachments and menus, our plugin then continues to import theme options, widgets, menu assignments, and important site settings.
